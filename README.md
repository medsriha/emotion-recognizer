# Emotion_Recognizer
OpenCV: Emotion Recognizer (Python)

A python program to detect users’ emotions through their facial expressions. Processed 20k images from the CK+ database, classified face pictures using Haar features-based cascades classifier, and used the Linear Discriminant Analysis method for the training process as an efficient technique to maximize the distance of different classes while minimizing the variance.
